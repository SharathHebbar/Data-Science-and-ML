# **Alpha (α)** and **P-values**
In conducting a test of significance or hypothesis test, there are two numbers that are easy to get confused. These numbers are easily confused because they are both numbers between zero and one, and are both probabilities. One number is called the **p-value** of the **test statistic**. The other number of interests is the level of significance or **alpha(α)**. We will examine these two probabilities and determine the difference between them.

## Hypothesis Test
There are two types of hypothesis namely:
1. **Null Hypothesis**
2. **Alternative Hypothesis**

The **null hypothesis** of a test always predicts no effect or no relationship between variables.<br>
The **alternative hypothesis** states your research prediction of an effect or relationship.

In hypothesis tests, two errors are possible, **Type I** and **Type II** errors.
<br>
**Type I error**: Supporting the **alternate hypothesis** when the **null hypothesis** is true.
<br>
**Type II error**: Not supporting the **alternate hypothesis** when the **alternate hypothesis** is true.

## Alpha Values

The number **alpha (α)** is the threshold value that we measure **p-values** against. It tells us how extreme observed results must be in order to **reject** the **null hypothesis** of a **significance test**.<br>

The value of **alpha(α)** is associated with the **confidence level** of our test.<br><br>
Example: <br><br>
For results with a 90 percent level of confidence, the value of **alpha(α)** is 
1–0.90 = 0.10.<br><br>
In general, for results with a 'C' percent level of confidence, the value of **alpha(α)** is 1-(C/100).<br><br>
The most commonly used **alpha value (α)** is 0.05 or 5%. The reason for this is both because consensus shows that this level is appropriate in many cases, and historically, it has been accepted as the standard.<br><br>
The **alpha(α)** value gives us the probability of a **type I error**. **Type I errors** occur when we **reject** a **null hypothesis** that is actually true. Thus, in the long run, for a test with a level of **significance** of 0.05 = 1/20, a true **null hypothesis** will be rejected one out of every 20 times.
