Joblib is a set of tools to provide **lightweight** pipelining in Python. In particular: transparent disk-caching of functions and lazy re-evaluation (memoize pattern) easy simple **parallel computing**.

## Why it is used?
- Better performance 
- reproducibility
- Avoid computing the same thing twice
- Persist to disk transparently

## Features

- Transparent and fast disk-caching of output value
- Embarrassingly parallel helper
- Fast compressed Persistence
